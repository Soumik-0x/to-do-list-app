# To-Do List App

A simple and responsive To-Do List application built with React.js and Vite. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, prioritize, and categorize tasks. It also includes a countdown timer feature for tasks and persists tasks in local storage to maintain state across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a title, description, priority, due date, due time, and category.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Users can set the priority of each task (Low, Medium, High).
- **Categorize Tasks**: Users can assign categories to tasks.

- **Countdown Timer**: Displays a countdown timer for each task.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage to persist across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes. On larger screens, tasks appear beside the input form, while on smaller screens, tasks appear below the input form.
